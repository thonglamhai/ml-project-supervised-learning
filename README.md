# machine_learning_project-supervised-learning

## Project Outcomes
- Supervised Learning: use supervised learning techniques to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a patient has diabetes or not, based on certain diagnostic measurements.The project involves three main parts: exploratory data analysis, preprocessing and feature engineering, and training a machine learning model. 
### Duration:
Approximately 3 hours and 20 minutes.
### Project Description:
The project is to use the diabetes dataset from Kaggle to build a supervised learning model that can predict whether or not a person has high risk to the diabetes in the future.
#### Project structure
The project has two main files: `diabetes.csv` and the notebook `Supervised Learning-Project.ipynb`

#### The project process
##### EDA
- Descriptive statistic
- Handling missing values
- Handling duplicated values
- Handling outliers

##### Scaling
- Handling scaling data using Standard Scaler

##### Normalization
- Handling normalized data using Min Max Scaler

##### Handling imbalanced data
- Checking if there is imbalance data in the dependent variable and handle it if it is necessary

##### Feature selection

##### build Model
- Build model by LinearRegression
- Build model by XGB
- Build model by RandomForestRegressor

##### Evaluation
- Evaluation using mean squared error, auc-score and f1 score
